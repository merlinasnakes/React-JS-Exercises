/* 
=====Exercise=====
MyComponent has a visibility property which is initialized to false. The render method returns one view if the value of visibility is true, and a different view if it is false.

Currently, there is no way of updating the visibility property in the component's state. The value should toggle back and forth between true and false. There is a click handler on the button which triggers a class method called toggleVisibility(). Pass a function to setState to define this method so that the state of visibility toggles to the opposite value when the method is called. If visibility is false, the method sets it to true, and vice versa.

Finally, click the button to see the conditional rendering of the component based on its state.
